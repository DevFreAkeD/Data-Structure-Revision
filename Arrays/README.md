# Arrays
An array data structure is a fundamental concept in computer science that stores a collection of elements in a contiguous block of memory.

An array is a collection of items of the same variable type that are stored at contiguous memory locations. Each item in an array is indexed starting with 0 . Each element in an array is accessed through its index.

## Need of Array Data Structures
- Storing data for processing
- Implementing data structures such as stacks and queues
- Representing data in tables and matrices
- Creating dynamic data structures such as linked lists and trees

## Types of Array
- **One-dimensional arrays:** These arrays store a single row of elements.
- **Multidimensional arrays:** These arrays store multiple rows of elements.

## Array Operations
- **Traversal:** Visiting each element of an array in a specific order (e.g., sequential, reverse).
- **Insertion:** Adding a new element to an array at a specific index.
- **Deletion:** Removing an element from an array at a specific index.
- **Searching:** Finding the index of an element in an array.

### Syntax of Array Declaration
`data_type array_name [size];`
  or
`data_type array_name [size1] [size2]...[sizeN];`

**Example:**
`int arr_int[5];` // array of integers
`char arr_char[5];` // array of characters

### Array Initialization
1. Array Initialization with Declaration: `data_type array_name [size] = {value1, value2, ... valueN};`
   Example: `int arr[5] = {12, 10, 3, 5, 99];`

3. Array Initialization with Declaration without Size: `data_type array_name [] = {value1, value2, ... valueN};`
   Example: `int arr[] = {12, 10, 3, 5, 99};`
